## How can I help?

1. Visit the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F_AhRoapqCk8A7S-d9hqNMssbh6DgShdeD8cixknh2E/edit?usp=sharing) (request access to edit the spreadsheet) and put your discord username in the "labeler" column for the mask(s) you'll be working on and change the status to "In Progress." If you're new, please start off with just one so we can leave you feedback; this is to prevent you from having to redo them because of something done incorrectly.

2. Spend some time studying already merged masks to see how things are labeled.
4. Start labelling! Useful label tools:
   * [csgo-labeler](https://label.selfplaylabs.com) (Only compatible with Chrome and Edge. Other browsers like Brave, Firefox, and Opera, even if chromium based, don't work properly. Must also be used with browser zoom and monitor scaling disabled.)

   * An external image manipulation tool such as [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)/[Krita](https://krita.org/) (Free) or [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) (Paid).
If you choose to use an external tool please ensure your color mode is set to 8-bit, and that antialiasing doesn't change the colors on the edges of your mask.

5. Fork this repository to your account using the "Fork" button in the top right
6. Create a **new branch** from the **main** branch, and use your labelling tool of choice to label some images
7. Open a pull request from your new branch to the main branch in the official repository to submit your changes!
8. Visit the #csgo-labels channel on the [Selfplay Labs Discord](http://selfplaylabs.com/discord) for the latest news and chat about the project.
